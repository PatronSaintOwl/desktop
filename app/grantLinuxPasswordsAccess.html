              <p class="sk-p">
                Using local storage, your account keys may be more easily
                accessible by third-party programs, unlike in your password
                manager which has additional protections built-in.
              </p>
              <p class="sk-p">
                In either cases, the strongest way to protect your account keys
                is to use a strong passcode, which will be used to encrypt your
                keys and prevent any software or operating system from reading
                them.
                <strong
                  >If you plan on setting a passcode, you can safely use local
                  storage.</strong

                Note that

                  granting access to your password manager will allow Standard

                >
                Standard Notes will never use this privilege to do anything more
                than reading and writing to its own entry.
